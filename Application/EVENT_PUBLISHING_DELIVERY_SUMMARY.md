---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Event Publishing Pattern

All three handlers follow this consistent pattern:

```go
// 1. Add imports
import (
    // ... existing
    "helixtrack.ru/core/internal/middleware"
    "helixtrack.ru/core/internal/websocket"
)

// 2. After successful database operation
username, _ := middleware.GetUsername(c)

// 3. Publish event
h.publisher.PublishEntityEvent(
    models.ActionCreate,  // or ActionModify, ActionRemove
    "entity_type",
    entityID,
    username,
    map[string]interface{}{
        // entity data
    },
    websocket.NewProjectContext(projectID, []string{"READ"}),
)

// 4. Send HTTP response
c.JSON(http.StatusOK, response)
```

### Event Types Generated

**Ticket Events:**
- `ticket.created` - When ticket is created
- `ticket.updated` - When ticket fields are modified
- `ticket.deleted` - When ticket is soft-deleted

**Project Events:**
- `project.created` - When project is created
- `project.updated` - When project fields are modified
- `project.deleted` - When project is soft-deleted

**Comment Events:**
- `comment.created` - When comment is added to ticket
- `comment.updated` - When comment text is modified
- `comment.deleted` - When comment is soft-deleted

### Context Resolution

**Direct Context (Ticket, Project):**
- Entity has `project_id` field
- Context: `websocket.NewProjectContext(projectID, []string{"READ"})`

**Hierarchical Context (Comment):**
- Entity belongs to ticket, ticket belongs to project
- Query: `SELECT project_id FROM ticket WHERE id = ?`
- Context: `websocket.NewProjectContext(projectID, []string{"READ"})`

**Self Context (Project):**
- Entity IS the project
- Context: `websocket.NewProjectContext(projectID, []string{"READ"})`

### Error Handling

**Database Failure:**
```go
_, err := h.db.Exec(...)
if err != nil {
    // Return error - NO EVENT PUBLISHED
    return
}
// Event published only after success
```

**Context Not Found:**
```go
var projectID string
err := h.db.QueryRow(...).Scan(&projectID)

if err == nil && projectID != "" {
    // Only publish if context found
    h.publisher.PublishEntityEvent(...)
}
```

**Event Publishing Failure:**
```go
// Best-effort - doesn't fail the operation
h.publisher.PublishEntityEvent(...)

// Continue with HTTP response
c.JSON(http.StatusOK, response)
```

## Verification Steps

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Start Server with WebSocket Enabled:**
   ```bash
   cd Application
   ./htCore --config=Configurations/dev_with_websocket.json
   ```

2. **Open Interactive Test Client:**
   ```bash
   # Open in browser:
   file:///path/to/Application/test-scripts/websocket-client.html
   ```

3. **Test Each Integrated Handler:**

   **Ticket Operations:**
   - [ ] Create ticket → Verify `ticket.created` event received
   - [ ] Modify ticket → Verify `ticket.updated` event received
   - [ ] Delete ticket → Verify `ticket.deleted` event received
   - [ ] Verify event data matches created/modified/deleted ticket
   - [ ] Verify project context included in event

   **Project Operations:**
   - [ ] Create project → Verify `project.created` event received
   - [ ] Modify project → Verify `project.updated` event received
   - [ ] Delete project → Verify `project.deleted` event received
   - [ ] Verify event data matches created/modified/deleted project

   **Comment Operations:**
   - [ ] Create comment → Verify `comment.created` event received
   - [ ] Modify comment → Verify `comment.updated` event received
   - [ ] Delete comment → Verify `comment.deleted` event received
   - [ ] Verify ticket ID included in event
   - [ ] Verify project context inherited from ticket

4. **Test Error Cases:**
   - [ ] Invalid data → No event published
   - [ ] Database error → No event published
   - [ ] Missing permissions → No event published

5. **Test Multi-Client:**
   - [ ] Open two browser tabs with WebSocket client
   - [ ] Create ticket in one → Verify event received in both
   - [ ] Test subscription filtering (different subscriptions)

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Run existing handler tests
cd Application
go test -v ./internal/handlers/...

# Run WebSocket integration test
cd test-scripts
./test-websocket.sh

# Expected: All tests pass, events published correctly
```

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Imports added correctly
- [ ] Event publishing after successful DB operation
- [ ] Username extracted from middleware context
- [ ] Proper context type selected
- [ ] Event data includes all relevant fields
- [ ] Error handling correct (no event on failure)
- [ ] Code style consistent with existing handlers

## Remaining Work

### Immediate Next Steps (High Priority)

**Phase 1 Handlers (JIRA Feature Parity):**

1. **Priority Handler** (~45 min)
   - 3 operations (CREATE, MODIFY, REMOVE)
   - System-wide or organization context
   - Test with interactive client

2. **Resolution Handler** (~45 min)
   - 3 operations (CREATE, MODIFY, REMOVE)
   - System-wide or organization context
   - Similar to Priority handler

3. **Version Handler** (~90 min)
   - 5 main operations (CREATE, MODIFY, REMOVE, RELEASE, ARCHIVE)
   - Additional operations (add/remove affected tickets, add/remove fix versions)
   - Project context
   - More complex than Priority/Resolution

4. **Filter Handler** (~60 min)
   - 4 operations (SAVE, MODIFY, REMOVE, SHARE)
   - Project or user-based context
   - Sharing requires special handling

5. **Custom Field Handler** (~90 min)
   - 3 main operations (CREATE, MODIFY, REMOVE)
   - Additional operations (option management, value setting)
   - Project context
   - Complex due to options and values

6. **Watcher Handler** (~30 min)
   - 2 operations (ADD, REMOVE)
   - Project context via ticket
   - Simpler than others

**Estimated Total for Phase 1:** 5-6 hours

### Short-term (Standard Handlers)

7-17. Board, Cycle, Workflow, WorkflowStep, TicketStatus, TicketType, Component, Label, Asset, Repository, TicketRelationship handlers

**Estimated Total:** 8-12 hours

### Medium-term (Organization Handlers)

18-20. Account, Organization, Team handlers

**Estimated Total:** 3-4 hours

### Long-term (Special Handlers)

21-23. Audit, Auth, Permission handlers (review needed)

**Estimated Total:** 2-3 hours

### Total Remaining Effort

**Best Case:** 18-20 hours
**Realistic:** 25-30 hours
**With Testing:** 35-40 hours

## Integration Strategy Recommendations

### Recommended Approach: Hybrid

1. **Phase 1 (This Week):** Manually integrate Priority, Resolution, Version handlers
   - Critical for JIRA parity
   - Complex logic requires careful integration
   - Time: 5-6 hours

2. **Phase 2 (Next Week):** Script-assisted integration of standard CRUD handlers
   - Board, Cycle, Component, Label, Asset, etc.
   - Use pattern from `HANDLER_EVENT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Time: 8-12 hours

3. **Phase 3 (Following Week):** Careful manual integration of organization handlers
   - Account, Organization, Team
   - Multi-tenancy considerations
   - Time: 3-4 hours

4. **Phase 4 (Final):** Review and integration of special handlers
   - Audit, Auth, Permission
   - Security and logging considerations
   - Time: 2-3 hours

**Total Time:** 18-25 hours spread over 3-4 weeks

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅

- **Core infrastructure:** Thoroughly tested, stable
- **Integration pattern:** Proven with 3 handlers
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive, clear
- **Testing tools:** Working, validated
- **Error handling:** Graceful, non-breaking

### Medium Risk ⚠️

- **Volume of work:** 20 handlers remaining
  - **Mitigation:** Clear documentation, established pattern
- **Context resolution:** Some entities have complex hierarchy
  - **Mitigation:** Examples provided for hierarchical context
- **Testing coverage:** Need to add handler-specific tests
  - **Mitigation:** Test patterns documented

### High Risk ❌

None identified. The integration is low-risk, well-documented, and follows established patterns.

---

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

- **Event Publishing:** Non-blocking, asynchronous
- **Context Resolution:** 1 additional database query per MODIFY/REMOVE operation
- **Memory Usage:** Minimal (event data is lightweight)
- **Network:** Event data ~500-1000 bytes per event

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Cache Context Data:**
   - Cache project_id lookups to reduce queries
   - Consider adding project_id to handler context

2. **Batch Operations:**
   - For bulk operations, batch events
   - Reduce per-operation overhead

3. **Event Data Optimization:**
   - Only include changed fields in MODIFY events
   - Use diff pattern for large entities

**Priority:** Low (current performance acceptable, optimize later if needed)
