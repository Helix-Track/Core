# The system scripts

All scripts required for the system to intialize (database, generated code, etc.) are located here.

Scripts are divided as:

- Standalone scripts
- Utility scripts.

The naming convention used for the naming is the following:

- `Main.Purpose.sh`, for the standalone scripts, where the 'Purpose' is the name of script's main functionality
- `Util.Purpose.sh`, for the utility scripts, where the 'Purpose' is the name of script's utility functionality.
